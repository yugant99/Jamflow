* For file name : - > batch_01,json is what we want content of 
Json , this json contains title, description , content,  code_examples, 
Then there is a json in it again ,we want that as well, title, description , content , code_examples 
There is a json in it this same file batch_01 and it has the same structure , as the other 2 json 
At this point you can assume that this is the third json then it is the json for the third url it is scraping 
I want to do the same for the files batch_02.json, batch_03.json , batch_04.json 
Then we have other files these files have ddifferent naming format so make sure refex just refers every single json 
But ensure it doesnt do duplicates man 
It doesnt need to go into duplicate files 
Thirdly , 
These other files they follow a different convention of actually making it in such a way that the main content is everything inside a key of a json key called 
“Data “ this has three main components in it title , description , content ,code_examples , in files three is also a section called sections, not all but this is relevant info  
Other things arent really relevant in these files whatever is in these 4 main components
